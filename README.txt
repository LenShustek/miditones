*                               About MIDITONES
*
*
*  MIDITONES converts a MIDI music file into a much simplified stream of commands,
*  so that a version of the music can be played on a synthesizer having only
*  tone generators without any volume or tone controls.
*
*  Volume ("velocity") and instrument specifications in the MIDI files are generally
*  discarded.  All the tracks are prcoessed and merged into a single time-ordered
*  stream of "note on", "note off", and "delay" commands.
*
*  This was written for the "Playtune" Arduino library, which plays polyphonic music
*  using up to 6 tone generators run by the timers on the processor.  See the separate
*  documentation for Playtune.  But MIDITONES may prove useful for other tone
*  generating systems.
*
*  The output can be either a C-language source code fragment that initializes an
*  array with the command bytestream, or a binary file with the bytestream itself.
*
*  MIDITONES is written in standard ANSI C (plus strlcpy and strlcat functions), and
*  is meant to be executed from the command line.  There is no GUI interface.
*
*  The MIDI file format is complicated, and this has not been tested on a very
*  wide variety of file types.  In particular, we have tested only format type "1",
*  which seems to be what most of them are.  Let me know if you find MIDI files
*  that it won't digest and I'll see if I can fix it.

*  This has been tested only on a little-endian PC, but I think it should work on
*  big-endian processors too.  Note that the MIDI file format is inherently
*  big-endian.
*
*
*  *****  The command line  *****
*
*  To convert a MIDI file called "chopin.mid" into a command bytestream, execute
*
*     miditones chopin
*
*  It will create a file in the same directory called "chopin.c" which contains
*  the C-language statement to intiialize an array called "score" with the bytestream.
*
*
*  The general form for command line execution is this:
*
*     miditones [-p] [-lg] [-lp] [-s1] [-tn] [-b] [-cn] [-kn] [-v] <basefilename>
*
*  The <basefilename> is the base name, without an extension, for the input and
*  output files.  It can contain directory path information, or not.
*
*  The input file is the base name with the extension ".mid".  The output filename(s)
*  are the base name with ".c", ".bin", and/or ".log" extensions.
*
*
*  The following command-line options can be specified:
*
*  -p   Only parse the MIDI file;  don't generate an output file.
*       Tracks are processed sequentially instead of being merged into chronological order.
*       This is mostly useful when generating a log to debug MIDI file parsing problems.
*
*  -lp  Log input file parsing information to the <basefilename>.log file
*
*  -lg  Log output bytestream generation information to the <basefilename>.log file
*
*  -sn  Use bytestream generation strategy "n".
*       Two strategies are currently implemented:
*          1: favor track 1 notes instead of all tracks equally
*          2: try to keep each track to its own tone generator
*
*  -tn  Generate the bytestream so that at most n tone generators are used.
*       The default is 6 tone generators, and the maximum is 16.
*       The program will report how many notes had to be discarded because there
*       weren't enough tone generators.  Note that for the Arduino Playtunes
*       library, it's ok to have the bytestream use more tone genreators than
*       exist on your processor because any extra notes will be ignored, although
*       it does make the file bigger than necessary . Of course, too many ignored
*       notes will make the music sound really strange!
*
*  -b   Generate a binary file with the name <basefilename>.bin, instead of a
*       C-language source file with the name <basefilename>.c.
*
*  -cn  Only process the channel numbers whose bits are on in the number "n".
*       For example, -c3 means "only process channels 0 and 1"
*
*  -kn  Change the musical key of the output by n chromatic notes.
*       -k-12 goes one octave down, -k12 goes one octave up, etc.
*
*  -v   Add velocity information to output
*
*
*  *****  The score bytestream  *****
*
*  The generated bytestream is a series of commands that turn notes on and off, and
*  start delays until the next note change.  Here are the details, with numbers
*  shown in hexadecimal.
*
*  If the high-order bit of the byte is 1, then it is one of the following commands:
*
*    9t nn [vv] Start playing note nn on tone generator t.  Generators are numbered
*           starting with 0.  The notes numbers are the MIDI numbers for the chromatic
*           scale, with decimal 60 being Middle C, and decimal 69 being Middle A (440 Hz).
*           If the -v option is enabled, a second byte is added to indicate velocity.
*
*    8t     Stop playing the note on tone generator t.
*
*    F0     End of score: stop playing.
*
*    E0     End of score: start playing again from the beginning.
*           (Shown for completeness; MIDITONES won't generate this.)
*
*  If the high-order bit of the byte is 0, it is a command to delay for a while until
*  the next note change..  The other 7 bits and the 8 bits of the following byte are
*  interpreted as a 15-bit big-endian integer that is the number of milliseconds to
*  wait before processing the next command.  For example,
*
*     07 D0
*
*  would cause a delay of 0x07d0 = 2000 decimal millisconds, or 2 seconds.  Any tones
*  that were playing before the delay command will continue to play.
